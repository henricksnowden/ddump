ddump reads the input of a file and dumps it to stdout. This is my attempt to create a terminal editor that reads without relying on cat or less. You would ordinarily never need this, this is a just a for fun project that predicates my journey to writing a full fledged text editor in C.
Of course, you can redirect output elsewhere just as much as you can pipe it.
Some systems still fail to page such as WSL terminal (Ubuntu).
